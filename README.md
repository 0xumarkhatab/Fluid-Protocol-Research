# Fluid Protocol Research Document

## Overview
Fluid Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that serves as a unified liquidity layer for lending, borrowing, and trading. Its goal is to reduce liquidity fragmentation and enhance capital efficiency by pooling funds that multiple protocols can access.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Collateral:**  
  Assets pledged as security for a loan.
  
- **Collateral Ratio:**  
  The value of collateral divided by the borrowed amount; Fluid Protocol maintains a minimum of 135%.
  
- **Liquidation:**  
  The process of selling collateral when its value falls too low relative to the debt.
  
- **Stablecoin (USDF):**  
  A digital asset designed to maintain a stable value. In Fluid, USDF is redeemable through a process that adjusts both the collateral and the corresponding debt.

## Protocol Features and Mechanisms

This section describe what the protocol does and how its core functions operate.

- **Unified Liquidity Layer:**  
  A single pool of funds that multiple protocols tap into, which avoids isolated liquidity pools and increases capital efficiency.

- **Automated Limits:**  
  The system automatically adjusts borrowing limits and collateral ceilings when available funds near capacity. This helps prevent sudden large trades ("whale moves") from destabilizing the platform.

- **Integrated Protocols:**  
  - **Lend Protocol:** Enables users to lend their assets directly to the liquidity pool without incurring fees.  
  - **Vault Protocol:** Designed for borrowers, offering benefits such as improved capital efficiency, competitive borrowing rates, and lower liquidation penalties.

- **Multi-Collateral Support:**  
  The protocol accepts various collateral types (e.g., FUEL, ETH, wstETH, EzETH, weETH, RsETH), spreading risk and enhancing overall liquidity.

- **Stablecoin Redemption Process:**  
  USDF is redeemed using a single method where the protocol selects collateral from debt positions near the 135% threshold. Instead of allowing users to pick a specific asset, it distributes a pro-rata share of the available collateral types. For example, if 60% of the collateral is valued at $2 per unit and 40% at $1.8 per unit, redeeming 600 USDF will return the appropriate mix of both, with any applicable fees deducted.

## Economic Model and Design Trade-offs
This section explains the underlying economic choices and potential compromises made in the protocol's design.

- **Interest-Free Borrowing:**  
  Fluid Protocol offers borrowing without fees or recurring charges, making it attractive to users. However, this fee-free model raises questions about long-term revenue generation and sustainability.

- **Revenue Generation & Sustainability:**  
  Future plans may include introducing fees or premium services. Strategic partnerships—such as Fluid’s cooperation with Barter—have helped Fluid account for over 10% of DEX trading volume on Ethereum, reinforcing its market presence and liquidity.

- **Liquidation and Redemption Trade-offs:**  
  - **Lower Liquidation Penalties:**  
    Lower penalties benefit borrowers during market volatility but might reduce the incentive for liquidators to act promptly, potentially allowing risky positions to persist.
  - **Redemption Mechanism:**  
    Collateral is redeemed even from positions above the minimum collateral ratio (with corresponding debt reduction). While this maintains system liquidity, it might seem counterintuitive to some users.

## Security Audits
- **MixBytes Audit (around June 2024 )**
  The audit identified 1 Critical , 1 High and 1 Medium Issue . [View Report](https://github.com/mixbytes/audits_public/blob/master/Instadapp/Fluid/README.md#finding-severity-breakdown)
- **Immunefi Audit (14 November 2024 - 12 December 2024):**  
  The audit identified 4 critical issues and 1 medium issue. [View Report](https://reports.immunefi.com/fluid-protocol)
  

## Pros and Cons
This section summarize the advantages and challenges without re-explaining detailed mechanisms.

### Pros
- **Interest-Free Liquidity:**  
  Borrowers enjoy fee-free borrowing.
- **Stable Collateral Requirements:**  
  The fixed 135% minimum collateral ratio contributes to system stability.
- **Efficient Capital Usage:**  
  The unified liquidity layer minimizes fragmentation and makes funds more accessible.
- **Multi-Collateral Diversity:**  
  Accepting various collateral types reduces risk.
- **Strong Market Presence:**  
  Partnerships, such as with Barter, have helped Fluid capture significant DEX trading volume on Ethereum.

### Cons
- **Revenue and Sustainability Concerns:**  
  The current fee-free model may need adjustments or external funding for long-term viability.
- **Liquidation Incentives:**  
  Lower liquidation penalties might delay corrective actions, potentially increasing the risk of lingering bad debt.
- **Redemption Process Perception:**  
  The method of redeeming collateral—even from well-collateralized positions—might appear counterintuitive, despite the balanced reduction in debt.
